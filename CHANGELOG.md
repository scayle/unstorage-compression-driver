# @scayle/unstorage-compression-driver

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Cleaned up README.md and added CONTRIBUTING.md. No functional changes.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependency `unstorage@1.17.0` to `unstorage@1.17.1`

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Added optional OpenTelemetry tracing around compression and decompression events. To enable this feature, add the buildtime environment variable `UNSTORAGE_COMPRESSION_OTEL_TRACE=true`.

### Patch Changes

- Added dependency `@opentelemetry/api@^1.9.0`

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Removed `destr` as dependency and and replaced its usage with `JSON.parse` for string to object parsing.
  Depending on the payload size, this should have marginal positive impact on the overall parsing performance.
  This is an internal refactoring and does not affect usage.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Drop CommonJS support. The package is now ESM-only. If you are using this package in a Nuxt 3 context, you should have no issues.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependency `unstorage@1.15.0` to `unstorage@1.16.0`

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependency `unstorage@1.13.1` to `unstorage@1.14.0`

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix publishing error which caused some files to be missing

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Resolved warnings with the types and exports configuration reported by `AreTheTypesWrong`[https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io]. This was done as a preventative measure to protect against potential ESM or TypeScript issues.

  Additionally, we now build the library with `unbuild` rather than `tsc`.

  This is essentially an internal refactor and should have no user-visible changes. However, as part of this change, the `compression` and `types` export configurations were removed from `package.json`. The exports were unused, but are mentioned here as it could possibly result in a breaking change.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependency `unstorage@1.12.0` to `unstorage@1.13.1`

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Introduce `@scayle/unstorage-compression-driver` package as custom [unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io/) driver. It allows to compress values with `deflate`, `gzip` or `brotli` using `node:zlib` while passing the data source handling to a generic supported driver like `redis` or `Vercel KV`.
